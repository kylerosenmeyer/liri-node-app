Coding Bootcamp HW10 by Kyle Rosenmeyer

**Liri Bot** is a node entertainment app built by Kyle Rosenmeyer. It displays concerts, music and movie information from user requests, and records then in a .txt file.

This app is useful to learn the principals of using node.js to access API's, display information in the console, and record information to external files.

This project is not available for additional contribution from the github community, however
Kyle Rosenmeyer may be contacted through his website for help or questions
regarding the project.
